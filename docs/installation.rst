Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

The primary prerequisite of MamaCAS is `Django`_ itself. MamaCAS is tested
with and supports all `supported versions`_ of Django. Other versions of
Django may work, but are not officially tested or supported. See the `Django
downloads`_ page for download and installation details.

If you're installing MamaCAS manually, such as from the `GitHub`_ repository,
you'll also need to install the `Requests`_ library. The optional `gevent`_
module may be installed to enable asynchronous single logout requests. The
optional `defusedxml`_ module may be installed to enable the /samlValidate
endpoint.

Installing
----------

Installing the latest release is easiest with `pip`_::

   $ pip install django-mama-cas

To manually install the latest release, download it from `PyPI`_ and install
with::

   $ python setup.py install

If you need the latest development code, clone the active development
repository on `GitHub`_::

   $ git clone git://github.com/jbittel/django-mama-cas.git

Configuring
-----------

Add MamaCAS to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting within your project's
``settings.py`` (or equivalent) file::

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       # ...existing apps...
       'mama_cas',
   )

Once added, run ``migrate`` to create the required database tables.

URL paths
~~~~~~~~~

Include the required CAS URL endpoints in your project's root ``URLconf``
(usually ``urls.py``) with the following::

   from django.urls import include, re_path
   
   urlpatterns = [
       # ...existing urls...
       re_path(r'', include('mama_cas.urls')),
   ]

This makes the CAS server available at the top level of your project's
URL (e.g. ``http://example.com/login``). To add a path to the CAS root
(e.g. ``http://example.com/cas/login``) include the path in the URL regular
expression::

   from django.urls import include, re_path
   
   urlpatterns = [
       # ...existing urls...
       url(r'^cas/', include('mama_cas.urls')),
   ]

Authenticating
--------------

One or more `authentication backends`_ must be `installed and configured`_
based on your authoritative authentication sources. MamaCAS does not
perform authentication itself, but relies on the active authentication
backends. The process of installing and configuring authentication backends
will change depending on the individual backend.
