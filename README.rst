MamaCAS is a Django `Central Authentication Service (CAS)`_ single sign-on
and single logout server. It implements the CAS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 protocols,
including some of the optional features.

CAS_ is a single sign-on and single logout web protocol that allows a user
to access multiple applications after providing their credentials a single
time. It utilizes security tickets, unique text strings generated and
validated by the server, allowing applications to authenticate a user without
direct access to the user's credentials (typically a user ID and password).

The source code can be found at `github.com/jbittel/django-mama-cas`_, and is
the preferred location for contributions, suggestions and bug reports.
Documentation is available at `django-mama-cas.readthedocs.org`_.

Contributing

GitHub pull requests. New code should follow both `PEP8`_ and the `Django
coding style`_, generally respecting the style of the surrounding code. When
